# Integration Tests crate

This crate contains e2e integration tests for the Migaloo project.

The intention is to make sure the system operates as intended by recreating real-world scenarios where all the components
of the project are working together in unison, where different actors (good and bad) interact with the system in different
ways, and where the components are under different loads.
